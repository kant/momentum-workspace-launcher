# Momentum-Workspace-Laucher
 A Alfred Workflow to kill any apps that won't be used and open just the only ones you need.  
 Saving CPU/Memory but also helping you to keep focus. üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è



### I'm really focus on doing things one at at time and focusing on whatever needs my atention. 
### Living with ADHD for decades, I learned how to setup my workflow to avoid any disruption on my attention spam. 

### That means, closing any app that will not help me to achieve my goals in that moment.

### I know that are a few apps that can launch a group of apps (or kill it) baseade on an interface selections.
### The Question for me was how to implement a simple workflow on Alfred (that I use for almost everything during my day) that will kill any apps (saving power and CPU/Memory) and then open only the Apps used for the purpose. 

#  üêæ Future Updates:

> 1. I'm planning to create a easy setup to name Workplaces and configure a list of apps groubed by usage in the future, but still need some help to learn how to do it.


In this meantime, I hope that you enjoy the Workflow. And drop me a line at momentum-workspace-launcher@rigonatti.com to any suggestions.
